## Overview

Orbit is a maintained and improved fork of [Tovy](https://github.com/tovyblox/tovy), the open-source staff management platform for Roblox. It gives group owners and staff teams the tools they need to manage members, run sessions, enforce policies, and track activity — all from a single, intuitive interface.

Team Planetary continues the original Tovy mission: keep the platform actively maintained, fix long-standing bugs, and introduce meaningful new features. Since forking, we have resolved critical issues that rendered Tovy unusable, refreshed the UI, added image support to the group wall, and launched Planetary Cloud — a free, one-click hosting solution built on a custom runtime.

---

## Features

Orbit ships with a comprehensive set of management tools out of the box:

| Category | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Member Management** | Warn, promote, demote, and bulk-manage group members |
| **Roles & Access** | Create custom roles, invite users, or sync directly with your Roblox group |
| **Activity Tracking** | Monitor member activity and enforce staff requirements |
| **Inactivity Notices** | Automatically track and flag inactive members |
| **Integrations** | Rank members via Orbit Integrations |
| **Communication** | Message members directly within Orbit; post to the group wall with image support |
| **Documentation** | Host your group's docs natively inside Orbit |
| **Policies** | Create and assign policy documents for members to review and sign |
| **Sessions** | Schedule and host sessions with minimal overhead |

---

## Getting Started

### Planetary Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and easiest way to run Orbit is through **Planetary Cloud** — our free, managed hosting service. No configuration required.

👉 **[Get started at planetaryapp.us](https://planetaryapp.us)**

---

### One-Click Deploy to Vercel

> [!WARNING]
> **We strongly recommend using Planetary Cloud instead of Vercel.**
> 
> Vercel's serverless architecture introduces real limitations that affect Orbit's reliability — including cold starts, execution timeouts, and constraints on long-running processes like session handling and activity tracking. You may run into hard-to-debug issues that simply don't exist on Planetary Cloud.
>
> Vercel support ended with v2.1.11beta.1. Version v2.1.10beta21 is the last Vercel-supported release. Later releases do not receive Vercel support because Vercel's serverless infrastructure limits memory caching.
> More information can be found in the latest update announcement ([Discord Announcement](https://discord.com/channels/1348101138670682156/1363239258659487864/1534022285453951087)).
>
> **[Planetary Cloud](https://planetaryapp.us) is free, purpose-built for Orbit, and works out of the box — no configuration needed.** We can't guarantee a great experience on Vercel, and support for Vercel-specific issues is limited.

Prefer to host on your own Vercel account? Deploy in seconds:

<a href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPlanetaryOrbit%2Forbit%2Ftree%2Fv2.1.10beta21&env=SESSION_SECRET,DATABASE_URL,PUBLIC_URL&build-command=npx%20prisma%20db%20push%20%26%26%20npx%20prisma%20generate%20%26%26%20npx%20next%20build%20--webpack">
  <img src="https://vercel.com/button" alt="Deploy with Vercel" />
</a>

**Required environment variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | A strong secret string — generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your database connection string (e.g. [Supabase](https://supabase.com), [Railway](https://railway.app), [Neon](https://neon.tech)) |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` or `PUBLIC_URL` | Your deployment URL, without a trailing slash (e.g. `https://instance.planetaryapp.cloud`) |

---

### Self-Hosting

For full self-hosting instructions, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.planetaryapp.us).

#### System Requirements

Orbit is designed to run on a small Linux server, but we recommend giving it enough resources for Node.js, dependency installation, and Next.js builds.

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---:|---:|
| **CPU** | 2 cores | 2–4+ cores |
| **RAM** | 2 GB | 4 GB+ |
| **Storage** | 10 GB | 20 GB+ SSD |
| **Database** | Any Prisma-compatible DB | PostgreSQL |
| **Node.js** | 20+ | Latest supported LTS |
| **OS** | Linux | Linux |

> [!WARNING]
> You cannot use MongoDB, as MongoDB's database interface is NoSQL, and Orbit was programmed to be in SQL-like interface (such as PostgresSQL), and therefore is not compatible with MongoDB.

> [!TIP]
> **An SSD is strongly recommended.** Orbit's dependencies can consume a significant amount of disk space, particularly `node_modules`, and Next.js builds perform a considerable amount of disk I/O. We recommend having at least 20 GB of available storage for a comfortable installation.

The minimum requirements are intended to represent the lowest practical configuration for running Orbit, not a recommended production environment. For production installations, we recommend **4 GB or more of RAM and SSD storage**.
